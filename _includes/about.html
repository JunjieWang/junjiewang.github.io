			<p class="about">My name is Robins Patel, though my since childhood my friends have called me Ravi. <br><br>I grew up (mostly) in Massachusetts and went to Boston University to study Computer Engineering. During my senior year, three friends and I started <a href="http://sharewithpitch.com">Pitch</a>, a file sharing application for Windows. It's currently being revamped and should be released very soon.<br><br>This site is a continuous work in progress, and with that, this page will be always expanding.</p>

			<h4 class="hi" >I have a number of interests but...</h4>
         <p class="about">my main interest revolves mostly around technology entrepreneurship. This includes but is not limited to: product design, strategy, and culture. Thankfully the entrepreneurship field is very active in the Boston area and there are always <a href="/events.html">events</a> which allow me to interact with incredibly smart people.<br>I'll be posting some of my <a href="/favorites.html">favorite</a> resources (books, articles, websites) soon.</p>
             
             <h4 class="hi" >In my free time...</h4>
         <p class="about">I enjoy trying out new technologies. <a href="http://https://news.ycombinator.com/news"> Hacker News</a> is perfect for this as there are always new tools and languages being posted (usually with the resources to learn more about them).<br><br>Fret not, I also love spending quite a bit of time on non-tech related things including:              <div id="listoffav">
            <ul class="ula">
                <li>Photography: First started with a Canon XT in high school and was lucky enough to win awards at the <a herf="http://www.artandwriting.org">Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.</a> </li>
                <li>Reading: I love my fair share of tech books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Woz-Computer-Getting-Apples-Inventor-ebook/dp/B000VUCIZO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393568883&sr=8-1&keywords=iwoz">iWoz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1393568924&sr=8-2&keywords=zappos">Delivering Happiness</a> but also really like fiction novels. My latest favorite is Neil Gaiman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ocean-at-End-Lane-ebook/dp/B009NFHF0Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393568992&sr=8-1&keywords=ocean+at+the+end+of+the+lane">The Ocean at the End of the Lane</a>. I'll post more on my <a href="/favorites.html">favorite</a> page soon. </li>
                <li>Outdoors: I am fortunate enough to be in Massachusetts where I get to hike in state forests, kayak in the Charles, jog down Plymouth harbor, bike on the Cape, and swim off the coast of the islands (At least when it's not winter).</li>
                <li>Fashion: Clothes are pretty important to me and as such, I try to pay quite a bit of attention to what I purchase. Some of the best resources for this have been <a href="http://styleforum.net">Styleforum</a>, <a href="http://superfuture.com">superfuture</a>, <a href="http://dappered.com">Dappered</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice"> r/malefashionadvice</a>.</li>
                <li>Design: From UX to a well designed pen, I prefer to take design more seriously than the average person.</li>
                <li>Travel: As much as possible.</li>
