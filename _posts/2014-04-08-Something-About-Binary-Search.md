Binary Search
=========

Binary Seach is a very useful algorithm. Today, I will summarize it, as a reminder for me. This blog will includes the following:

  - What is Binary Search
  - The implementation
  - Search for upper bound and lower boud
  - Search for interval
  - Search in rotated sorted-array
     - Kth in one array
     - Kth in two array
  - Caculate sqrt
  - Search on mutiple server
  - Summary

When we study an algorithm, not only we need to understand the basic idea and implementation of it, but also we should try to analysis the complexity of it, including time and space complexity.
