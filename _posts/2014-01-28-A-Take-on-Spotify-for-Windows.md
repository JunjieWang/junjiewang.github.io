# Where is the Windows 8 Spotify app?

![spotify-1](/images/post-images/spotify-3.png)


**Even after over a year** after the Modern UI was introduced alongside Windows 8, many major app developers haven't started taken advantage of the platform. It wasn't until nearly a [year later](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4846000/facebook-windows-8-official-app-launch) that Facebook released Windows 8 app. 

There is certainly a calling for more apps on the Windows app store, so much so that the store is riddled with low quality apps that attempt to mimic popular services using APIs, like  this slew of [Instagram apps](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/search#q=instagram&s=Store). One of the apps that I'm surprised doesn't have first party offering is Spotify. It's on nearly every device ([including receivers](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/), and [*even Blackberry*](http://news.spotify.com/us/2011/12/21/spotify-for-blackberry-available-now/)) imaginable...except Windows 8 (there is a x86 Windows app that runs only in desktop mode, but not for the Modern UI). 


[The app](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/cbbddd16-5d65-453b-b556-de3e7b3afa15) that is meant to be a compromise for Windows 8 (Modern UI/RT) Spotify users leaves *a lot* to be desired -- but that's because it's not from Spotify, it's just by some developer making use of their APIs.

There's also a web app Spotify provides, but it has limited functionality compared to native applications -- much like the compromise app above.

The user interface environment Microsoft provides is perfect for Spotify's goals and Spotify should take advantage of it and take control of the experience their customers receive (especially when many people who purchase a new PC will search for their favorite apps in the app store.)

I've taken some time to experiment with how Spotify could provide an experience that is on par with their Mac and x86 Windows app, while taking advantage of the new UI features the Modern UI offers.

###Horizontal Scrolling Galore

####Hero

The horizontal scrolling nature of Windows 8 apps would allow Spotify to finally have a proper hero section. It's incredibly difficult to find what is "new and important" in the current Spotify app. You can stuff that may be "new and important" by going to "Browse" to see Highlights and News, or going to "Discover" and finding a hero image about an artist that doesn't appear in the Highlights section in "Browse". I can open the iTunes store, and instantly know what's new -- why can't I with Spotify? 

A large introductory hero portion to their app would give Spotify a place to tell me exactly what is important: new playlists, new releases, news, etc.

####A Consistant Experience 

User's don't want to relearn how to use apps they're already used to on their other devices when they get Windows 8.

By maintaining the core structure of the user interface found in the Mac/Windows desktop app, Spotify can provide a consistent experience while taking advantage of Windows 8 UI elements. 

Notice how we can provide a cleaner interface by taking advantage of the full screen nature of Windows 8 and a bit more white space.

####Always there

Having a horizontally scrolling app on Windows means that information is always readily available. 

With my take on the app, we can provide the three major components things on screen, at all times: 1) the hero 2) main navigation 3) social. The main navigation screen being the most important. 

On a fresh start, we can set the app to open to the hero.   Other times, we can open to the main navigation screen -- with the hero a simple swipe right. 

The most apparent social feature of Spotify is the activity feed and with a horizontally scrolling UI, we can have it constantly update off to the side. It can be kept always fresh, and always available with a slight swipe left.

The other major portions of the app include the Browse and Discover screens. We could make these available at all times further to the right of the screen, but I do not think the cost to benefit ratio is favorable.

The Windows 8 market is constantly growing, and until companies begin bring major apps to the store, the number of subpar apps that attempt to substitute these apps will also keep growing. Developers need to take control of their user experiences, and despite a different UI environment on Windows 8, they may not even need to completely rethink how their apps work.
